A ProgressBar should be used to indicate either progress in terms of steps that the user
needs to complete or to denote that something is not properly ready yet

A ProgressBar can have different colors:

```typescript jsx
<Box width={1}>
  <Box mb={6}>
    <ProgressBar color="blue-600" progress={0.6} />
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <ProgressBar color="red-200" progress={0.9} />
  </Box>
</Box>
```

A ProgressBar can have different thickness:

```typescript jsx
<ProgressBar color="blue-600" thickness={2} progress={0.6} />
```
