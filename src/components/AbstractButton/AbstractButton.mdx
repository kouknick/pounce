The `AbstractButton` is a component that's not opinionated in terms of UI but encapsulates the
basic responsibilities of a button.

Use this component to wrap something that's clickable just like a button, but it doesn't
look like a typical button (in which case you would have used `<Button>`).

```typescript jsx
<Box>
  <AbstractButton onClick={() => alert('clicked')}>
    <Img
      size={150}
      src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10436045?s=400&u=09293d4486f1fd66ee75d014821062c20b33e13e&v=4"
      alt="avatar"
    />
  </AbstractButton>
  <br />
  Click the image
</Box>
```
