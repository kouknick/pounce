```typescript jsx
<Box>
  <Text color="gray-200" size="large">
    This is some text
  </Text>
  <Text color="gray-200" size="medium">
    This is some text
  </Text>
  <Text color="gray-200" size="small">
    This is some text
  </Text>
  <Text color="gray-200" size="extra-small">
    This is some text
  </Text>
</Box>
```

You can change the props as usual:

```typescript jsx
<Text color="blue-400" size="large">
  This is some bigger text
</Text>
```

You can also change the underlying dom element:

```typescript jsx
<Text color="red-300" size="large" as="p">
  This is the same bigger text as a paragraph tag
</Text>
```
